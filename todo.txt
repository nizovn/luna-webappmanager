_ spec wants the icon to change to a spinner when connecting,
  but ActivityIndicator is =really= slow when used in a ListView delegate.
  This seems like it should be low-hanging fruit but not sure how to implement
  inside the ListView? Using a stand-in "(Connecting...)" for now.

_ spec wants rows to slide up and down on the page when they transition from
  connected to disconnected & back again.

_ spec wants the main settings page (ie, the system-settings window, not the
  bluetooth plugin window) to indicate via different bluetooth icons whether
  bluetooth is on or off and whether or not there's a connection.

_ "Signal Strength" is currently a lie, it's always listed as "Fair".
  This information doesn't seem to be provided by bluez?

_ spec wants a small histogram of signal strength.
  Not implemented.

_ spec wants the pin entry dialog to hover over the other window;
  currently it overlays the entire window

_ spec wants "Connect to a different headset:" to have a spinner indicating
  when we're looking for other devices every 5 seconds. Current implementation
  is to always watch for new devices when the page is open.

_ spec's "Provide Passkey" dialog is overlaid over the Bluetooth page.
  Implementation has a fullpage dialog.

_ spec's text entry field in "Provide Passkey" dialog doesn't behave or
  look the same as Ubuntu/Components/TextField.qml. (Update spec?)

_ spec has nothing to say about the "Confirm Passkey" dialog. (Update spec?)
